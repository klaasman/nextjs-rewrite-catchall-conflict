      <h1>Next.js Routing Precedence Bug Report</h1>

      <p>
        Routing conflict between URL rewrites and catch-all routes during
        client-side navigation.
      </p>

      <p>Required conditions to reproduce:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Presence of middleware.ts (even if empty)</li>
        <li>Catch-all route ([...segments].tsx) with fallback: false</li>
        <li>
          Request path (/200) not included in catch-all route&apos;s prebuilt
          segment pathnames
        </li>
        <li>
          Proxied endpoint returns 2xx status code (issue doesn&apos;t occur
          with non-2xx responses)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style={{ marginTop: "4rem" }}>Test Case #1: 200 Status Response</h2>

      <Link prefetch={false} href="/200">
        Test rewrite to httpstat.us/200
      </Link>

      <p>
        During client-side navigation, the catch-all route incorrectly takes
        precedence over the configured rewrite to httpstat.us when the proxied
        endpoint returns a 2xx response. Server-side navigation (hard refresh)
        works as expected.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>
          Note: The Next.js router attempts to prefetch data from:
          <code>/_next/data/development/200.json?segments=200</code>. This
          request gets proxied to httpstat.us, which returns its original 200
          response (not JSON).
          <br />
          The router might interpret this successful response as confirmation
          that the page exists locally, leading to incorrect client-side
          navigation instead of following the rewrite rule..?
        </em>
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ marginTop: "4rem" }}>Test Case #2: 400 Status Response</h2>

      <Link prefetch={false} href="/400">
        Test rewrite to httpstat.us/400
      </Link>

      <p>
        Control case: Demonstrates that the rewrite works correctly with non-2xx
        responses. The issue only occurs when the proxied endpoint returns a
        successful (2xx) response.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>
          Note: This will show a &quot;400 Bad Request&quot; response - this is
          expected and actually proves the rewrite is working correctly (the
          error comes from httpstat.us as intended).
        </em>
